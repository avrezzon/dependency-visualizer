# Dependency Visualizer

A React-based interactive tool for visualizing and managing version dependencies within a microservice architecture. This application helps track relationships between core libraries, repositories, and applications (readers/processors), identifying dependency drifts and simulating version bumps.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of dependency chains (Core -> Repositories -> Apps).
- **Dependency Drift Detection**: Automatically identifies when an application is built against an older version of a dependency.
- **Version Management**: Simulate Major/Minor/Patch version bumps for any node.
- **Rebuild & Update**: One-click action to update an application's dependencies to the latest versions and bump its patch version.
- **Filtering & Inspection**: Filter by category (Foundation, Data Access, Readers, Processors) and inspect specific node details.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
